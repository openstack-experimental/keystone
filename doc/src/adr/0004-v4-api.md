# 4. v4 API

Date: 2025-11-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

New authentication workflows cannot be covered with the existing Keystone v3
API. As such it is required to add new API methods and eventually change the
existing. As such not to break compatibility and provide a relatively easy way
to route the traffic allowing both project (python and rust) to co-exist a new
v4 API version should be introduced.

## Decision

- All new auth methods MUST be implemented in v4.

- Known issues with the v3 API SHOULD be addressed in the v3.

## Consequences

- New extended functionality will not be available in the v3.

- Certain necessary changes may be ported to the v3 (including python) to
  implement backwards compatibility. Example: acknowledge new token payload
  issued with v4 with the python Keystone.
